                In the above image, I wanted to have a thin vertical bar of a certain width and a certain background color to indicate either a certain status or other color-coded states of things (levels, goals, roles, etc.)

                I had an inner container set to fixed width, but since I cannot set the value of the width, I played with the size of its inner elements (in this case, it was an icon set to 2 width) and the inner padding (set to 4 horizontal) to achieve the desired width of the bar.
